# wad-rs library

This library will creates a higher level abstraction for wad files. It indexes the wad file with almost no heap allocation.
It converts old data formats to modern ones. i.e. 8-bit sound samples and midi data to f32 audio buffers or sprites to image buffer with alpha channel.

## THIS LIBRARY IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS
